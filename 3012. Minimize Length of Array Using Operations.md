# 3012. Minimize Length of Array Using Operations
## Classification
Trick -> Modulo
## Backtrack
I tried to find a pattern on which numbers should I remove from array. I use a heap as a container and remove the two biggest numbers. I guess I did this to avoid 1? 

Biggest concern in the my approach: It seems impossible to find a pattern on which number I should keep in the array. If I pick an x and a y, should I leave `x%y`, or `y%x`? I got stuck here.
## Walkthrough
The most important observation in this problem are:
1. zeros are not wanted
2. the smallest element can remove the whole array. `small % big = small`, all we need to worry is the `0s` coming from smallest elements cancelling each other. 
3. the smallest element may not be the smallest element in the original array, it can also be generated from mod operations. If this case happens, return 1, because this is a unique number and it can remove the whole array.
## Code
```
min_ = min(nums)
count_min = Counter(nums)[min_]
zeros = (count_min + 1) // 2
for num in nums:
    if num % min_ != 0:
        return 1
return zeros
```
## Thoughts
1. why this approach is correct? because use the smallest element to remove the rest of array leaves minimum elements(0). smallest elements cancelling each othere is unavoidable.
