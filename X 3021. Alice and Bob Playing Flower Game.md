# X 3021. Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game
## Classification
Counting/Math
## Walkthrough
Figure out 3 points:
1. on a single clockwise/counter-clockwise path, if odd num of flowers, alice win; if even num of flowers, bob win.
2. so we can infer, if Alice plays optimally, if sum of two path is odd, alice win; if sum of two path is even, bob win.
3. math.floor(n/2) is total number of even numbers <= n; math.ceil(n/2) is total number of odd numbers <= n
## Code
```
def flowerGame(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        odd = lambda n: ceil(n/2)
        even = lambda n: floor(n/2)
        return odd(n)*even(m) + odd(m)*even(n)
```
