# 2211. Count Collisions on a Road
## Classification
Monotonic Stack
## Backtrack
I got this question wrong on first 4 submissions, due to I didn't run enough test cases on them, so not all senarios are considered.
## Observations
We can extract from question descriptions:
1. When meeting an S, or meeting R and L colide, this will result in a 'wall'. When 'wall' appears,
   1. Extract from above, when S appear, all previous R between the new S and (maybe) old S will collide into the new S
   2. Example: LSRRRL, 'RL'->collide += 2
   3. LSRRS, 'RR'->(collide += 1) * 2
   4. LSS, collide = 4
   5. This also applies to L, since we are using a monotonic stack, it will be handled differently
## Code
```
def countCollisions(self, d: str) -> int:
    stack = []
    res = 0
    def right_collide():
        nonlocal stack,res
        while stack and stack[-1] == 'R':
            stack.pop()
            res += 1
        stack = ['S']
        return
    for i in range(len(d)):
        if d[i] == 'R':
            stack.append('R')
        if d[i] == 'S':
            right_collide()
        if d[i] == 'L':
            if stack and stack[-1] == 'R':
                stack.pop()
                res += 2
                right_collide()
            elif stack and stack[-1] == 'S':
                res += 1
    return res
```
## Thoughts
This is a simulation question with hidden conditions, I need to run more test case manually to discover the hidden condition.
