# 2536. Increment Submatrices by One
## Walkthrough
1. This is a cut-down-num-of-ops question
2. A usual trick-matrix can be represented by list-rows, list-cols, can we use this?
   1. Doesnt seems so. 2n digit cannot represent n^2 grids
3. Sweepline?
   1. 10^4 query, each query can take at most 500 lines
   2. This gives O(n) as 10^6
   3. Worth a try
## Code
```
def rangeAddQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    matrix = [[0] * n for i in range(n)]
    for [r1,c1,r2,c2] in queries:
        for r in range(r1,r2+1):
            matrix[r][c1] += 1
            if c2 < (n-1):
                matrix[r][c2+1] -= 1 
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(1,n):
            matrix[r][c] += matrix[r][c-1]
    return matrix
```
