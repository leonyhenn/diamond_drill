# 2874. Maximum Value of an Ordered Triplet II
## Walkthrough
1. Order of the list doesn't matter. In the end of the day we will have (max(list)-min(list))*sorted(list)[-2]
   1. Wrong. Order matters. i have to <j and j have to <k.
2. We use j as variable, keep tracking the maximum number left to j and right to j
## Code
```
def maximumTripletValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    left_max = [nums[0]]
    right_max = [nums[-1]]
    for j in range(1,len(nums)):
        left_max.append(max(left_max[-1],nums[j]))
    for j in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
        right_max.append(max(right_max[-1],nums[j]))
    right_max = right_max[::-1]
    res = 0
    for j in range(1,len(nums)-1):
        res = max(res,(left_max[j-1]-nums[j])*right_max[j+1])
    return res
```
## Thoughts
I rushed to get results, did not check index on right/left, I thought their size is len(nums)-1, which in fact is len(nums).
