# 962. Maximum Width Ramp
## Observations
it' essentially for each j, find the smallest i s.t. i < j and nums[i] <= nums[j]
## Approaches
1. Sorting, O(NlgN)
    ### Intuition
    We are looking for the non-larger value with the leftest index. It's a two-factor problem, and two factor will contradict each other. For example, if we record the smallest value, there might be a bigger value but still less than current nums[j] with a smaller index; if we record the smallest index, the nums[smaller_index] might not be non-larger than nums[j]. So if we can eliminate one factor, this will simplify the problem.
    ### Code
    ```
    def maxWidthRamp(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = [[nums[i],i] for i in range(len(nums))]
        nums.sort()
        smallest_idx = nums[0][1]
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i][1] < smallest_idx:
                smallest_idx = nums[i][1]
            else:
                res = max(res,nums[i][1]-smallest_idx)
        return res
    ```
    As the array is sorted by (nums[i],i), we can guarantee for each nums[j], the recorded nums[smallest_idx] has a value <=nums[j]. Thus we only need to calculate the ramp.
