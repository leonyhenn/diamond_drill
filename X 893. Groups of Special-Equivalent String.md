# 893. Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings
## Observations
1. any can swap -> two string with same anagram can form same lexicographically sorted string. e.g. HEART and EARTH can both form AEHRT
2. any odd/even can swap -> we can have a lexicographically sorted string formed by even characters and a lexicographically sorted string formed by odd characters, then use the two to form a new string.
## Code
```
def numSpecialEquivGroups(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
    memo = defaultdict(int)
    L = len(words[0])
    for word in words:
        even = []
        odd = []
        for i in range(L):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even.append(word[i])
            else:
                odd.append(word[i])
        even.sort()
        odd.sort()
        i,j = 0,0
        new = ""
        while i < len(even) or j < len(odd):
            if i < len(even):
                new += even[i]
            if j < len(odd):
                new += odd[j]
            i += 1
            j += 1
        memo[new] += 1
    return len(memo.keys())
                
```
## Backtrack
I had it wrong 3 times due to I did not read question throughly. I thought I was supposed to return the largest count, in fact I was asked to return how many 'forms'. It was caused by fatigue of doing too many questions.
## Classification
## Thoughts
How can I properly rest? Will drink some hot tea help?
